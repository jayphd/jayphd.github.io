<b>  Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillation in the Bay of Bengal (MISO-BOB) </b> <br>
At the University of Notre Dame, my research is funded through the MISO-BOB project sponsored by the US Office of Naval Research (ONR). The overarching goal of MISO-BOB is to understnd the interplay between strong and weak phases of South Asian Monsoon (SAM) and the Bay of Bengal. The warm basin of Bay of Bengal is a strong attractor for the equatorial weather signal, which otherwise prefer zonal (west-to-east) propagation, during the summer months. As a result, the eastward propagating tropical systems are pulled northwards by the Bay of Bengal. It appears that the strength of SAM is often determined by these nortward propagatring signals, and a complex coupling between ocean and atmosphere determine the course of SAM in a season. Thus, understading and modelling of this interaction is vital for monsoon forecasting. To this end, in situ field obsevations were collected using ships, buoys, WC130J aircraft, and weather baloons (radisondes) in the MISO-BOB project over the SAM region. My primary task is to investigate storm dynamics and atmospheric boundary layer processes with these observations.  <br>

<b>  Orographic influence on the cyclonic systems </b> <br>
In a weak background flow, the cyclonic storms in the tropics move westwards due to the planetary &#946 effect. Therefore, the cyclonic storms that form over the east Indian Ocean - Maritime continent region arrive at the east coast of India. Some of these storm stall over the coast and cause <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/87131/historic-rainfall-floods-southeast-india"> catastrophic flooding for several days</a>. The goal of this research is to identify the reasons behind the stagnation of these cyclonic storms so that we can bettter forecast the sever flooding events and prevent the loss of life. Initial invistigation hits that the weaker storms get blocked by the Eastern Ghats mountain ranges (<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/146/4/mwr-d-16-0473.1.xml"> Phadtare, 2018</a>). Currently, I am analyzing the vorticity budgets of the landfalling cyclonic storms to better understand the processes <br>

<p style="margin-right: 60px;"> Hi, thank you for visiting my website. I am a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href="https://efmlab.nd.edu/">Environmetal Fluid Mechanics Laboratory</a>
at the <a href="https://www.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>. I am working on the <a href="https://efmlab.nd.edu/research/miso-bob/"> MISO-BOB project</a> in which I am trying to understand the structure and evolution of monsoonal storms using high-resolution observations from ships and aircraft. I am also involved in the <a href = "https://efmlab.nd.edu/research/swex/">SWEX</a> project which studies the downslope windstorms over the mountains of southern California. These hot and dry winds cause wildfires in this region. 
  
 Previously, I was at the <a href="https://ncas.ac.uk/"> National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS)</a>, University of Leeds where I studied the influence of the Western Ghats on the summer monsoon rainfall over peninsular India from observations and models simulations as a part of the <a  href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~sws05agt/improve/"> IMPROVE project </a>. </p>

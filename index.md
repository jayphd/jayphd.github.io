Hi, thank you for visiting my website. I am a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href="https://efmlab.nd.edu/">Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory</a> at the <a href="https://www.nd.edu/"> University of Notre Dame</a>. I am a part of the <a href="https://efmlab.nd.edu/research/astral/"> ASTRaL </a>.  I am studying air-sea interactions at the mesoscale using observations from research cruises in the Indian Ocean. Previously, I was at the <a href="https://ncas.ac.uk/"> National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS)</a>, University of Leeds, where I studied orographic effects on winds and rainfall during the Indian summer monsoon using observations and model simulations as a part of the <a  href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~sws05agt/improve/"> IMPROVE project </a> </p>


<p>I did my Ph.D. at the <a href="https://caos.iisc.ac.in/"> Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</a>, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. For my Ph.D. thesis, I studied the dynamics of stationary cyclonic storms that were responsible for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_South_India_floods"> 2015 South India floods</a>. This was the first <a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-16-0473.1"> study</a> to link extreme rainfall over the east coast of India to the Eastern Ghats mountains.  I also wrote an <a href="https://jayphd.github.io/tracking/">automated cloud-tracking algorithm </a> to study the organization of deep convection in the INSAT satellite imagery. </p>
